This is a text based RPG written using a very limited knowledge of java

You will create your character by selecting a name and class. Each class has strengths and weaknesses. For example, the Archer has high attack, but is more susceptible to damage that the swordsman.

On your turn, you will select three things - whether you would like to attack or defend, what kind of attack/defense you want to use, and which enemy you would like to attack/defend against.

You will roll a virtual D20 to determine whether your attack succeeds or fails. 1-10 is a fail, 11-20 is a success. If your attack fails, the enemy will get a chance to attack you. If you choose to defend, your enemy will also "roll" a D20. If their attack misses, you will have a chance to counterattack.

Choosing to attack on your turn will slightly increase your attack for that turn, while defending will slightly increase your defense.
