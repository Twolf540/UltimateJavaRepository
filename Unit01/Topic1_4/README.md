# 1.4 Compound Assignment Operators
## 1_4 P1
Compound Assignment Operators
+ These all assign their result to the variable
+ (+=) - Adds the value to the current variable given value
+ (-=) - Subtracts the given value from the current variable value
+ (*=) - Multiplies the given value by the current variable value
+ (/=) - Divides the current variable value by the given value
+ (%=) - Finds the remainder of the current variable value divided by the given value

## 1_4 P2
Increment Operator (++) - Adds 1 to the value of the variable

Decrement Operator (--) - Subtracts 1 from the value of the variable

```
int x = 4;
x++;
System.out.print(x);
```
/\ Outputs 5

## 1_4 P3
Description:
+ Defines the integer variable x, assigns the value of x as 23
+ Defines the integer variable y, assigns the value of y as 17
+ Multiplies the current value of x by 4 and assigns it to x
+ Adds 1 to the current value of y and assigns it to y
+ Divides the current value of x by 3 and assigns it to x
+ Subtracts 9 from the current value of y and assigns it to y
+ Finds the remainder of the current value of x divided by the current value of y and assigns it to x
+ Displays the current value of x
