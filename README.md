# Ultimate Java Repository

This template is designed to hold all your notes and code from your AP Computer Science A studies. 

## Structure

There are subdirectories for each unit and topic of the course. Inside each topic subdirectory there is a `Main.java` file, and a `README.md`.

### `README.md`

Leave notes of things your learn while watching the videos in these files. To learn how to do fancy formatting using Markdown, see [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### `Main.java`

Try out the code you see in the videos, assigned questions, or that you write. Use the "Run" button to compile and run the code, or do it from a terminal:

```
javac Unit01/Topic1_1/Main.java
java Unit01.Topic1_1.Main
```
